# üêæ End-to-End Multi-Class Canine Breed Classification

This project involves creating an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

## 1. Problem Statement

The objective is to determine the breed of a dog based on an input image.

## 2. Data Source

The dataset utilized is sourced from Kaggle's competition on dog breed identification.

Link to the dataset: [Dog Breed Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification)

## 3. Performance Evaluation

Submissions are assessed using the Multi-Class Log Loss metric, measuring the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and observed targets.

For additional details on the evaluation, refer to the [Evaluation Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/overview) on Kaggle.

## 4. Data Characteristics

Key information about the dataset:

- The data is unstructured, consisting of image data.
- There are 120 distinct breeds of dogs, representing 120 different classes.
- The training set comprises 10,000+ images, and the test set contains an equivalent number.
