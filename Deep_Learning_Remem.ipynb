    "\n",
    "* Examine the structure of the dataset (number of samples, features, data types\n",
    "* Check for any missing values or anomalies in the data.a\n",
    "*Explore the distribution of features and target variables.\n",
    "* Identify any patterns or correlations in the data.b \n",

    "Data Cleaning:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Handle missing values: Decide whether to impute missing values, remove rows/columns with missing values, or use other techniques such as interpolation.\r\n",
    "Handle outliers: Decide whether to remove outliers, cap them, or use other techniques to mitigate their impact.\r\n",
    "Handle duplicate records: Remove duplicate entries if present.\r\n",
    "Normalize or scale features if necessary to ensure uniformity in the data distribution.\r\n",
    "Feature Engineering:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Create new features based on domain knowledge or insights gained from data exploration.\r\n",
    "Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\r\n",
    "Transform variables: Apply transformations such as log transformation, square root transformation, etc., to make the data more linear or Gaussian-like.\r\n",
    "Feature selection: Select the most relevant features that contribute most to the target variable and remove irrelevant or redundant features to simplify the model and reduce overfitting.\r\n",
    "Data Splitting:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.\r\n",
    "Typically, the training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.\r\n",
    "Model-specific Data Preparation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Some models may require specific data transformations or preprocessing steps. For example, deep learning models often benefit from standardization of input features.\r\n",
    "Iterative Process:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Data preparation is often an iterative process. After building an initial model, you may discover the need for further data cleaning or feature engineering based on the model's performance.\r\n",
    "Documentation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Document all the preprocessing steps performed on the dataset. This documentation helps ensure reproducibility and makes it easier to understand and replicate the data preparation process."
